    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <h2>Barkk is a telecommunication healthcare app for animals. For many pet owners, it can be hard to determine when it is necessary
        to bring your pet into a local veterinarian. Many times, an insignificant issue with your dog or cat can lead to spending hours 
        in the waiting room and a large bill to conclude a simple visit that couldve been treated at home. Every pet owner wants the 
        best for their animal, and sometimes it is hard to tell when a discoloration, a scratch, or a loss of appeite is a more serious 
        problem than it seems. Barkk is a company that provides veterinary services through the phone and in the comfort of your own home.
        Barkk offers a 24/7 live chat feature. If you're needing more, you can schedule video appointments with professional and experienced 
        veterinarians who can answer all your questions.
